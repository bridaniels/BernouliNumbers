# Bernoulli Distribution: 
- Discrete Distribution used when random experiment has boolen output 
- Probability Mass Function:
    - probability that a discrete random variable `X` takes on a particular value `x` that is `P(X=x)` -> denoted `f(x)` 
    - `P(X=x) = f(x)` 


# Bernouli Process
- Random Variable Either 1, or 0
    - 1 = Sucess, 0 = Failure
- Probability of Success is Constant 
- Results are Independt of One Another
